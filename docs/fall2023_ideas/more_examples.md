# More Examples

A more carefully made list of some examples we're missing, building from the "ground up".  In other words, taking a look at a more complete set of examples, both for raw caiman and explication, that start with just very basic variations of existing programs.

For a concrete goal, I will propose some number, like 10 "trivial examples", 3-4 "simple examples", and 1 "big example" program.  The alternative is to help develop the actual benchmarking software, but I worry about piling on extra tooling with little payoff.

## "Trivial" Examples

Written in psuedo-Rust code (basically Rust, but with `host`, `gpu`, and `cpu` attached to the types).  Note that any function definition not written can be assumed to be "external", which includes arithmetic operations like `+`.  Only functions and operations defined in the example should be implemented (for all of our sanities).

```c

```

## "Simple" Examples



## "Big" Examples

The "medium" examples from [examples.md](./examples.md).  Pick your favorite.

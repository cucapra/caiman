/// A map from node contents to a canonical node index.
///
/// This is essentially a bespoke chained hashmap. The implementation is simple because it's
/// *tightly* coupled to [`apply`]: it only needs to support [`get_or_insert`], so we don't have
/// to worry about entry deletion, iterators, etc. Three things to note:
/// 1. The chained entries are stored in a continguous vector for cache-friendliness.
///    Links between entries are given by an offset from the start of the vector.
/// 2. Although a hash of the node contents is stored, the "key" is actually the node index.
///    This allows us to get ~O(1) canonical index lookups *without duplicating the keys*.
///    This is the whole reason why we don't just use a `HashMap`.
/// 3. Because of (2), you must pass a reference to the graph to every mutating operation,
///    and you **must not mutate any nodes once their indexes have been added to the map.**

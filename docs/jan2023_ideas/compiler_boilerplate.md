Oliver has mentioned a bunch of potential compiler work that should be done, and
I'll throw my hat into the ring for where I could use help / work touching
things up.  No one thing here is a project I suspect, but could be useful as
warmup stuff, or expanding on the ideas.

1. Assembly language development.  I got the first bit working, and will
   hopefully have more features coming soon, but there's more to be done here
   that I won't have time for.  Specifically working out the full translation
   and cleaning up some of the rough edges around error messaging would be
   super helpful
